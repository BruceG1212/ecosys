README

By default, TigerGraph OS user has the full rights to start, stop, change configuration, edit files, etc. In production environment, a Operator may have much limited right to  operate the TigerGraph system.

This solution provides a way  such that the Operator can only start, stop and restart TigerGraph system,  check status, and view logs. The Operator can't do others to TigerGraph System.


 TigerGraph user: upload tg_op_daemon file to TigerGraph's ~/.gium folder
# As tigergraph user
# [tigergraph@ip-10-0-1-198 ~]$
gscp all tg_op_daemon ~/.gium/


TigerGraph user: run tg_op_daemon in background  (e.g., on m1)
# choose an unused port, e.g., 5005
# As tigergraph user
# [tigergraph@ip-10-0-1-198 ~]$
nohup tg_op_daemon 5005 > tg_op_daemon.log 2>&1 &


Operator user: upload tg_op_admin file to the same node that daemon is running (e.g., m1). Update these two lines in this file to match daemon port and log path.
...
# CHANGE these two accordingly
TCP_PORT = 5005 
LOG_PATG = "/tg/tigergraph/logs/"


Operator user: make sure the user can access TigerGraph's log dir (read access)
# To check, as Operator, list tigergraph's log dir


Operator user: run tg_op_admin as if it's TigerGraph's gadmin command.
[operator@ip-10-0-1-198 ~]$ tg_op_admin 
Need provide one of the commands:
  start
  stop
  log
  status
  restart
Note, tg_op_admin doesn't allow interactive mode command, so please add "-y" when running stop command. E.g.

[operator@ip-10-0-1-198 ~]$ tg_op_admin stop -y
[RUN    ] rm -rf /tg/tigergraph/logs/*.pid 
[RUN    ] rm -rf ~/.gsql/gstore_g*_autostart_flag
