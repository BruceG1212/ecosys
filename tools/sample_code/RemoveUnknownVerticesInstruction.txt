Instructions for removal of unknown vertices from tigergraph

1) clean_unknown_vertices : 
This is a gsql query which can be used to delete the unknown vertices in one run and all unknown vertices will be deleted from current data. 
However, if there are too many unknown vertices, the memory will not be released. Please use the readme as detailed instruction on how to 
install and run the query.

2) clean_deleted_segments: This is a script used to delete all deleted segments and release the corresponding memory. 
In order to be used to clean out all unknown vertices, one need to drop all vertex types with unknown vertices. Then follow the readme to 
reset the system and run the script. As a result, the unknown vertices will be cleanly wiped out from tigergraph system.
Disadvantage of this approach is that all data related with such type of vertices will be also deleted.
