This folder includes the queries and the data files to build a movie recommendation system using TigerGraph. The recommendation system can predict the movie ratings based on both the latent factor (model-based) and TF-IDF (content-based) methods.
Follow the instructions below to reproduce the demo in Graph Gurus 28:
1. In a Linux shell for your TigerGraph machine, change to the recommendation_system folder:

2. Create the graph schema for the Recommender graph:
gsql schema.gsql

3. Add the expression functions by copying the ExprFunctions.hpp file to the TigerGraph folder for query user-defined functions:
cp ExprFunctions.app /home/tigergraph/tigergraph/dev/gdk/gsql/src/QueryUdf

4.Install the queries:
bash setup.sh

5. Load the data into the Recommender graph 
gsql loader.gsql

6. To train the latent factor model, run the queries below in sequence 
6.1 splitData
6.2 normalization
6.3 Initialization
6.4 Training_validation

7. To compute the TF-IDF scores for the movies and users, run the queries below in sequence
7.1 TFIDF
7.2 TFIDF_normalization
7.3 userProfile
7.4 userProfile_normalization

8. To test the model and use it for recommendation, run the queries below
test
recommend
