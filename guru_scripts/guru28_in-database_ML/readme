This folder includes the queries and the data files to build a movie recommendation system using TigerGraph. The recommendation system can predict the movie ratings based on both the latent factor (model-based) and TF-IDF (content-based) methods.
Follow the instructions below to reproduce the demo in Graph Gurus 28:
1. In a Linux shell for your TigerGraph machine, change to the recommendation_system folder:

2. Create the graph schema for the Recommender graph:
gsql schema.gsql

3. Add the expression functions by copying the ExprFunctions.hpp file to the TigerGraph folder for query user-defined functions:
cp ExprFunctions.app /home/tigergraph/tigergraph/dev/gdk/gsql/src/QueryUdf

4.Install the queries:
bash setup.sh

5. Load the data into the Recommender graph 
gsql loader.gsql

6. To train the model, run the queries below.  
splitData
normalization
Initialization
Training_validation

7. To test the model and use it for recommendation, run the queries below.
(TFIDF,TFIDF_normalization, userProfile, userProfile_normalization,validation)
test
recommend
