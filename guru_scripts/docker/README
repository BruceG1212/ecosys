Pull Pre-built TigerGraph Docker Image 
============================================
One command pull docker image and bind all ports for first time user from TigerGraph  docker registry 

this image should start as a daemon, so user can ssh to it. 

Open a shell on your host machine
cd ~/
#below is the folder to share between your host machine and docker container.
mkdir data
#rm old version, only do this step if you upgrade your docker  image
docker rm -f tigergraph-dev-latest > /dev/null 2>&1
#pull the tigergraph docker image
docker run -d -p 14022:22 -p 9000:9000 -p 14240:14240 --name tigergraph_dev --ulimit nofile=1000000:1000000 -v ~/data:/home/tigergraph/data -t docker.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-latest:tigergraph-dev-latest

#see running container
docker container ls

# start container
docker container start tigergraph-dev-latest

# stop container
docker container stop tigergraph-dev-latest


Content of the Docker Image
================================
In the dev image, we include 

- ssh server 
- git
- wget
- curl
- emac, vim etc. 
- tar
- g++ version 4.8
- java version 1.8.0_212
- latest github gsql algorithm library
- tutorial: gsql 101, gsql 102 folder, tutorial folder
- latest gsql open source graph algorithm library: gsql-graph-algorithms folder

How to share data drive on your host with docker container
=============================================================
#e.g. 
cd ~/
#below is the folder to share between your host machine and docker container.
mkdir data
chmod 777 data
#mount it  to /home/tigergraph/data when you download the image
docker run -d -p 14022:22 -p 9000:9000 -p 14240:14240 --name tigergraph_dev --ulimit nofile=1000000:1000000 -v ~/data:/home/tigergraph/data -t docker.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-latest:tigergraph-dev-latest

# once you mount the data drive, on your host, you can put files under ~/data, it will be visible in /home/tigergraph/data. Vice versa, anything you put under /home/tigergraph/data within the container, 
# will be visible on your host machchine ~/data folder.

Since our dev edition does not support backup/restore data, you can persist your data (raw file, gsql script etc.)  on the data volume
After upgrading Dev version, you can start a new container using the same data volume. 

Start/shutdown Docker Desktop
===============================
- To shut down it, click you docker desktop, click "Quick Docker Desktop" will shutdown it. 
- To start it, find the Docker Desktop icon, double click it.

docker run -d -p 14022:22 -p 9000:9000 -p 14240:14240 --name tigergraph_dev --ulimit nofile=1000000:1000000 -v ~/data:/home/tigergraph/data -t docker.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-latest:tigergraph-dev-latest
#ssh to the container, if localhost is not recognized, remove localhost entry from ~/.ssh/known_hosts
ssh -p 14022 tigergraph@localhost
#enter password for tigergraph user
tigergraph
