GSQL for Cypher users
---------------------
This project is an implementation of the popular Neo4j movie database in TigerGraph's GSQL
language.  It's a learning resource for users who are already familiar with Cypher but now 
wants to learn TigerGraph's GSQL.

If you have used the movie database from Neo4jâ€™s tutorials/trainings, these implemented queries
should be familiar to you. Here are some of the example queries:

      . Retrieve all REVIEW relationships from the graph where the summary of the review contains the
        string "fun", returning the movie title reviewed and the rating and summary of the relationship
     
      . Retrieve the movies and their actors where one of the actors also directed the movie
           
      . Retrieve the actors who have acted in exactly five movies
      
      . Retrieve all nodes that the person named "James Thompson" directly has the FOLLOWS relationship 
        in either direction

The dataset is similar to the one used in the "Introduction to Neo4j" training class.

Pre-requisite:
-------------
1. Download and install TigerGraph Developer Edition prior to installing 
   the movie database solution.
