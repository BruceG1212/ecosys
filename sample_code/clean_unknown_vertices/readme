INSTRUCTION:
delete_unknown_by_type.gsql is a gsql query template targeted to clean out all unknown vertices of a given type
ExprFunctions.hpp provides the necessary expression functions  RemoveUnknownID

1)To generate the correct query for your own graph, you have to replace CONSTANT inside the query template. 
There are two CONSTANT
  a) _graphname_: one should replace this string with your own graph name string
  b) _VTYPE_: one should replace this string with your own vertex type name

2) cp the entire RemoveUnknownID function from ExprFunctions.hpp to your own ExprFunctions.hpp under $tigergraph/dev/gdk/gsql/src/QueryUdf/ExprFunctions.hpp. Make sure that this function is still inside the namespace of UDIMPL (copy the function into the bracket of namespace of UDIMPL)

3) install the modified query.

4) run the modified query with "gsql -g graphname DeleteUnknownByType()" or curl command.

5) check whether the unknown vertices were removed from the graph store or not.

6) if dryrun = true, we only report the number of unknown vertices and no deletion will be done.
